This is the underlying code for the research manuscript found at ____. 

The main file for running code is "Designing marine reserve networks to mitigate larval dispersal volatility with the connectivity portfolio effect - run.R".

There is a secondary file containing functions which does not need to be opened manually as it is called in by the main file ("Designing marine reserve networks to mitigate larval dispersal volatility with the connectivity portfolio effect - functions.R").

The x y coordinates of the reefs in the case studies are found in "imported habitat matrix.csv".

The dispersal probability matrices of the species in the case study are found in "imported probability matrix.csv".
